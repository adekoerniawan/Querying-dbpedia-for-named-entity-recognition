1,"The decision means essentially that every arm of Venezuela’s government is now under the thumb of President Nicolás Maduro, whose supporters have gone to great lengths to wrest authority from the National Assembly, which has been dominated by a slate of opposition parties since early 2016. The country’s top court, which is packed with Maduro loyalists, had already invalidated every major law passed by Congress. On Wednesday, as part of a decision involving the executive branch’s authority over oil ventures, the court declared that henceforth the judicial branch would execute all powers normally reserved for the legislature."
2,"n the end, it took two separate trips to Niger and almost two weeks on the ground before Mr. Ferguson captured an appropriately arresting image that also satisfied the compositional requirements: a scene showing a large crowd, with enough empty space at the top and bottom to display personal stories. But shooting the photograph was just the beginning. Mr. Ferguson then set to work identifying the subjects and conducting interviews which, given the fleeting circumstances of the food line, proved staggeringly difficult."
3,"These days, the last thing you want is to be known as a Friend of Trump.He’s doing great — he’s president, for heaven’s sake. His kids are getting jobs, his hotels are getting promoted 24/7. He goes golfing more than your average Palm Beach retiree. Meanwhile, the people he hangs around with are watching their reputations crumble into smithereens. This has an impact on congressional politics. If you’re a swing vote in the House or the Senate, the idea of getting a hug in the Oval Office might seem more like a threat than an opportunity. Let’s consider some of the F.O.T.s who’ve already been undone:"
4,"Such glorious days these are for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels. The basketball team is in the Final Four, a championship so close as to put the campus into a state of vibration. And Roy Williams, their down-home coach, finds himself celebrated for hill-country wit and hoops acumen."
5,"f I were to ask you to name one of the United States Great Lakes, specifically one that has four letters, the first one that would most likely come to your mind is Lake Erie. ERIE has been an entry in The New York Times Crossword many times, and is almost considered “crosswordese” because it is so commonly used. It would be easy to make it a habit to just plunk down ERIE as soon as you know you’re being asked about a Great Lake, wouldn’t it? So there you are at 1A and you have a four-letter slot for a Great Lake. Go on, write in ERIE. See where that gets you. I’ll tell you exactly where it gets you: nowhere. Because the answer to 1D is MING vase. And the answer to 2D, “Compatriot of Mao” is CHOU En-lai. The answer to 1A is a rebus, and the answer is Lake MICHIGAN, where two letters are to be placed in each square."
6,"A warning to the residents of the Upper East Side, especially those of you who live on one of those blocks so clean “yuh could eat a fried egg offen it.” Yank (probably better known to you as the Ape), that existentially challenged brute whom you humiliated into a suicidal spiral, has returned to your neighborhood. And he’s still as mad as hell. In a serendipitous marriage of theater and real estate, Richard Jones’s mesmerizing revival of Eugene O’Neill’s “The Hairy Ape” opened at the Park Avenue Armory on Thursday night, amid the blue-chip addresses where its title character roams and despairs. While it would be comforting to dismiss this 1922 drama as a fascinating anachronism, O’Neill’s nightmarish parable of alienation and class conflict still feels close to home."
